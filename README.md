# Constrained Coverage Mapping Simulation

## General
This repository contains scripts for the MAE598 - Multi Robot Systems project. It simulates swarm robotics for constrained coverage mapping, including obstacle detection and avoidance.

**Please credit Darius Irani if used in any publications or projects.**

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Downloading the Repository
1. Click on **Code** and select **Download ZIP**.
2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.

## Running the Simulation
1. Ensure all files are stored in the same folder.
2. Open the `main_script.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Adjust parameters in the **USER TUNABLE VARIABLES** section.
4. Run the script and follow the prompts in the MATLAB console.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Image Processing Toolbox is installed and active.
- If errors occur, confirm that all files are in the same directory and MATLAB has appropriate permissions.
